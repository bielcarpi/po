PO is a simple and intuitive programming language, fundamentally oriented towards the world of teaching. What is intended with this type of language is to achieve that it can be used as a first contact with the world of programming. The creators of the language want future programmers to be able to use it as a base language with which they can understand how the world of programming works. In this way, show a simple programming method and get more and more people encouraged to program and can participate in the community of software developers.
